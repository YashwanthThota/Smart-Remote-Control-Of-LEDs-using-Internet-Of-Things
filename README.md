The main aim of this project is to control an LED by using android application from any where across the world through internet.

-> Developed  an  Android  Application  to  control  an  Light  Emitting  Diode(LED) by using MIT app inventor 2. the LED.aia file can be imported to MIT appinventor 2 to view the source code.
-> The Internet connectivity for the LED is enabled by using Arduino uno and Ethernet Shield boards.  A  ‘C’  language  based  code  is  dumped  into  the  Arduino  board  using  Arduino interface
